    <p class="project-main-title">Nick Castellanos Swing Decision Investigation</p>

    <!-- Header Image -->

      <img src="strike3.jpg" alt="Strike analysis" class="header-img">
      <div class="header-img-caption">Nick Castellanos strikes out swinging on an 85mph "zone 14" slider from the Minnesota Twins' Simeon Woods Richardson.</div>
    </div>

    <p>Living in the Philadelphia market and being someone who consumes a good amount of Phillies baseball and local sports media, I've 
      heard plenty of discussion about Nick Castellanos's underwhelming offensive performance during the 2025 season. Following the 
      Phillies' early exit from the postseason, I wanted to take a closer look at the data to see whether some of the flaws I've noticed 
      in Castellanos's game are backed by the numbers. Using pitch-level data spanning his entire career, I set out to examine not 
      only whether those weaknesses were evident this year, but also how these aspects of his game have evolved over time.</p>

    <p class="specific-question"><strong>Specific question of interest:</strong> Does Nick Castellanos struggle with chasing the low and away breaking ball, and how can we address this issue?</p>

    <p class="section-header">Project layout</p>
    <p>This project was organized into the following three phases.</p>
    <div class="indented-list">
      <p>Phase 1: Problem identification and preliminary swing decision analysis</p>
      <p>Phase 2: Predictive modeling</p>
      <p>Phase 3: Sequence analysis and improvement strategies</p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Helpful visuals: </strong></p>
      <p>1. The first image is the strikezone with segmented areas that play a crucial role in the following analysis. The main flaw 
      identified in Castellanos' approach is a tendency to swing at a subset of pitches that are considered "low and away". This area of 
      interest for Castellanos (and all other right-handed batters) is designated by the number 14.</p>
      <p>2. The second image shows general pitch shapes from a side profile. The following analysis focuses on "breaking balls", which are 
        pitches that generally move down and away from the pitcher's hand after release. This umbrella of pitches includes sliders, curveballs, 
        sweepers, slurves, and knuckle-curveballs, and they have a characteristic downward hump as seen in the below image. For reasons that 
        we will not discuss at length, a changeup does not fall into this category despite having a similar "hump" shape from the side.
      </p>

    <p class="section-header">Phase 1: Problem identification and preliminary swing decision analysis</p>
    
    <p>You can't solve a problem that doesn't exist, and while most people wouldn't need to see the numbers to tell you that 
      Nick Castellanos struggles laying off the low and away breaking ball, I wanted to see just how bad this issue really was. 
      Below I present a mix of visuals that show some of Castellanos's swing tendencies for various pitches in and around the 
      strike zone.</p>

    <!-- Phase 1: First set of side-by-side images -->
    <div class="image-row">
      <div class="image-column">
        <img class="side-by-side-img" src="NCSwingRateBBs2.jpg" alt="Description of Image 1">
        <div class="project-img-caption">Nick Castellanos swing rate broken down by areas in and around the strike zone for 2025 breaking balls.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="image-column">
        <img class="side-by-side-img" src="NCWhiffRateBBs.jpg" alt="Description of Image 2">
        <div class="project-img-caption">Nick Castellanos whiff rate broken down by areas in and around the strike zone for 2025 breaking balls.</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Looking at the above visuals for the 2025 season, a few things become very clear.</p>
        <div class="indented-list">
          <p>- First, Nick Castellanos swung at the low and away breaking ball at a fairly high clip (44.6% of the time). Although I didn't have the time or space to download data for every player in the MLB, I did take a look at a few different players, and we can be assured that this is an above-average value.</p>
          <p>- Secondly, Castellanos sees this pitch a lot! With n = 392, Castellanos saw breaking balls in this zone 2.76x as often as the next most frequent zone (zone 13).</p>
          <p>- Finally, what happens when Castellanos swings at this pitch? If the outcome of these swing decisions is positive, this would not be a problem. However, the second image tells us that castellanos whiffed at over half of these pitches that he swung at.</p>
        </div>

    <!-- Phase 1: Full-width image -->
    <div class="image-column">
      <img class="full-width-img" src="NCSwingRateBBsCareer2.jpg" alt="Full width visualization">
      <div class="project-img-caption">Career progression of Nick Castellanos's swing decisions on breaking balls broken down by segments of the strike zone.</div>
    </div>

    <p>The above image details Nick Castellanos's swing decision tendencies on breaking balls over the course of his entire career. 
      As you can see, he hasn't improved at all! Interestingly, the year that he has the lowest chase rate (min n = 300) was also 
      the only year of his career that he hit over .300. This was also the year that he had the most homeruns and highest OPS. More 
      discipline typically helps you in more ways than one!</p>

    <!-- Phase 1: Second set of side-by-side images -->
    <div class="image-row">
      <div class="image-column">
        <img class="side-by-side-img" src="TTYoY.jpg" alt="Description of Image 3">
        <div class="project-img-caption">Trea Turner swing tendencies on zone 14 breaking balls in 2024 and 2025.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="image-column">
        <img class="side-by-side-img" src="CastyYoY.jpg" alt="Description of Image 4">
        <div class="project-img-caption">Nick Castellanos swing tendencies on zone 14 breaking balls in 2024 and 2025.</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Trea Turner is a great player to look at as a comparison because he also tends to chase the zone 14 breaking ball frequently 
      and sees this pitch thrown his way quite a bit. However, Turner was much more disceplined on that pitch this season relative 
      to last season. I'd think this discipline was likely a contributing factor in Turner winning the batting title for the NL. I 
      bring this example up as a demonstration of a player who made an adjustment to a similar flaw and saw success as a (likely 
      direct) result. While I don't have internal knowledge on how Trea's approach changed between last year and this year, the data 
      seems to suggest he placed an emphasis on laying off the low and away slider. Turner's 9 point increase in average was 
      accompanied by 17 more stolen bags, a 17 point jump in OBP, and more doubles and triples than he had last year, but fewer 
      home runs as well.</p>

    <p class="section-header">Phase 2: Predictive modeling</p>
    
    <!-- Copy your first existing paragraph here (with em dash removed) -->
    <p>While the heatmaps in Phase 1 clearly identified <em>what</em> the problem is (zone 14 breaking ball chases), they don't tell us <em>why</em> 
      these specific pitches are so exploitable. To dig deeper, I built two predictive models‚Äînot for real-time game use, but as 
      analytical tools to uncover the underlying patterns and drivers of chase behavior.</p>

    <!-- Copy your second existing paragraph here -->
    <p><strong>The Goal:</strong> Use machine learning to identify which pitch characteristics, count situations, and sequence patterns most 
      strongly predict chase decisions. This moves beyond simple observation to quantitative validation: confirming that the 
      breaking ball + location interaction isn't just correlation, but a consistently predictive pattern.</p>

    <!-- Copy your third existing paragraph here -->
    <p>Below, I'll present key findings from a Random Forest model and an LSTM sequence model. While the LSTM's performance was 
      limited (demonstrating that pitch-by-pitch prediction faces inherent uncertainty), both models provided valuable intelligence 
      on what makes certain pitches particularly dangerous and helped quantify the severity of Castellanos' vulnerability.</p>
