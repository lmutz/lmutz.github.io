    <p class="project-main-title">Nick Castellanos Swing Decision Investigation</p>

    <!-- Header Image -->
    <div class="header-image-container">
      <img src="strike3.jpg" alt="Strike analysis" class="header-img">
      <div class="header-img-caption">Nick Castellanos strikes out swinging on an 85mph "zone 14" slider from the Minnesota Twins' Simeon Woods Richardson.</div>
    </div>

    <p>Living in the Philadelphia market and being someone who consumes a good amount of Phillies baseball and local sports media, I've 
      heard plenty of discussion about Nick Castellanos's underwhelming offensive performance during the 2025 season. Following the 
      Phillies' early exit from the postseason, I wanted to take a closer look at the data to see whether some of the flaws I've noticed 
      in Castellanos's game are backed by the numbers. Using pitch-level data spanning his entire career, I set out to examine not 
      only whether those weaknesses were evident this year, but also how these aspects of his game have evolved over time.</p>

    <p class="specific-question"><strong>Specific question of interest:</strong> Does Nick Castellanos struggle with chasing the low and away breaking ball, and how can we address this issue?</p>

    <p class="section-header">Project layout</p>
    <p>This project was organized into the following three phases.</p>
    <div class="indented-list">
      <p>Phase 1: Problem identification and preliminary swing decision analysis</p>
      <p>Phase 2: Predictive modeling</p>
      <p>Phase 3: Sequence analysis and improvement strategies</p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Helpful visuals: </strong></p>
      <p>1. The first image is the strikezone with segmented areas that play a crucial role in the following analysis. The main flaw 
      identified in Castellanos' approach is a tendency to swing at a subset of pitches that are considered "low and away". This area of 
      interest for Castellanos (and all other right-handed batters) is designated by the number 14.</p>
      <p>2. The second image shows general pitch shapes from a side profile. The following analysis focuses on "breaking balls", which are 
        pitches that generally move down and away from the pitcher's hand after release. This umbrella of pitches includes sliders, curveballs, 
        sweepers, slurves, and knuckle-curveballs, and they have a characteristic downward hump as seen in the below image. For reasons that 
        we will not discuss at length, a changeup does not fall into this category despite having a similar "hump" shape from the side.
      </p>
